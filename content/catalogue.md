# Catalogue of technical dimensions

The technical dimensions framework breaks down discussion about
programming systems along various specific "axes". The dimensions identify
a range of possible design choices, characterized by two extreme points
in the design space.

The dimensions are not quantitative, but they allow qualitative comparison.
The extreme points do not represent "good" and "bad" designs, merely different trade-offs.

The set of dimensions provides a map of the design space of programming systems (see the
illustration). Past and present systems serve as landmarks, but the map also reveals unexplored
or overlooked possibilities.

The 22 technical dimensions are grouped into 7 clusters or topics of interest. 
Each cluster consists of individual dimensions, examples that capture a particular
known value (or a combination of values), remarks and relations to other dimensions.
