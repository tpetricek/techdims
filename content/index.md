# Technical dimensions of programming systems

![$](title=Abstract,link=paper;abstract)
Programming is done in a stateful environment, by interacting with a system through a
graphical user interface. The stateful, interactive and graphical environment is more
important than the programming language(s) used through it. Yet, most research focuses on comparing and 
studying _programming languages_ and only little has been said about _programming systems_.

Technical dimensions is a framework that captures the characteristics of programming
systems. It makes it possible to compare programming systems, better understand them, 
as well as to find interesting unexplored points in the design space of programming systems.
We hope that technical dimensions will help designers of programming systems to evaluate,
compare and guide their work and, ultimately, stand on the shoulders of giants.
