# Good old programming systems

A _programming system_ is an integrated set of tools sufficient for creating, modifying, and executing programs.
The classic kind of programming system consists of a *programming language* with a text editor and a compiler, but 
programming systems can also be built around interactive graphical user interfaces, provide various degree of 
integration between the runtime execution environment and leverage graphical notations.
Our notion accomodates examples from three broad classes of systems.

- _<i class="fa fa-code"></i> **Systems based around languages**._
Software ecosystems built around a text-based programming _language_. They consist of a set of tools such as compilers, debuggers, and profilers, accessible either through a command-line or a development environment.

- _<i class="fa-brands fa-windows"></i> **OS-like programming systems**._
Those that resemble an operating system in that they control both the execution environment and the resources of an entire machine. They provide a common interface for communication between programs and with the user.

- _<i class="fa fa-mobile-screen-button"></i> **Application-focused systems**._
Programmable _applications_, typically optimized for a specific domain, offering a limited degree of programmability, which may be increased with newer versions.

This page provides a brief overview of nine "Good Old Programming Systems" that feature as examples
in our discussion. For each of the system, you can look at its characteristics, also available
in the [comparison matrix](#left=index,matrix-intro;big=index,matrix-body;footer=index,navigation) 
and references sections of the [catalogue of technical dimensions](#top=catalogue,index;left=catalogue,list;footer=index,navigation)
where the system is discussed.
