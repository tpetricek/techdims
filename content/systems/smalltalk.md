----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
- id:dims-interaction
- shade: shade1
- characteristics: interaction-single, interaction-repl, interaction-open, interaction-principles

Integrated execution and editing mode, giving feedback at runtime. 
Abstractions constructed using objects are accessible via a browser.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
- id:dims-notation
- shade: shade2
- characteristics: notations-primary, notations, notations-uniform

Primary source code notation with graphical structure editor for object structure.
Secondary overlapping notations can be developed in-system. Small language.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
- id:dims-conceptual-structure
- shade: shade2
- characteristics: concepts-interface, concepts-minimal, concepts-composable, concepts-nonconvenient

Small number of unified concepts ("everything is an object") at odds with outside world.
Everything is composed from small number of primitives, but limits convenience. Structural commonality.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
- id:dims-customizability
- shade: shade3
- characteristics: custom-runtime, custom-addressing, custom-additive, custom-sustainable

System can be customized at runtime. Much of the system is written in itself and can be
modified from within itself. Extensibility achieved via object-oriented programming.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
- id:dims-complexity
- shade: shade3
- characteristics: complexity-gc, complexity-rich

Factoring using a rich class-based system covering system and application-level features.
Basic automation (garbage collection) with more possible through libraries & via reflection.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
- id:dims-errors
- shade: shade1
- characteristics: errors-dynamic, errors-interactive

Errors detected at runtime and can be corrected immediately in interactive editor/debugger.
Further detection possible via engineering testing tools.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
- id:dims-adoptability
- shade: shade1
- characteristics: adoptability-unified, adoptability-nonexperts, adoptability-community

Steep learning curve, but uniform design makes understanding reusable. End-users can progressively become programmers.
Active community, but closed world and limited packages.

# Smalltalk

[![](img/sys/smalltalk-78.png)](#image=systems/smalltalk,screen)

Smalltalk was developed as a communication system for "personal dynamic medium" that could be owned by 
everyone and could "handle virtually all of its ownerâ€™s information-related needs." As such, it is 
highly adaptable and customizable from within itself.

It is based on a small and coherent programming model based on object-oriented programming, embedded
in an image-based persistent interactive programming environment that makes it possible to explore, 
modify and debug the living system at all times.
